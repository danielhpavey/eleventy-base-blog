I am an enthusiastic and dedicated early career creative producer who has been training in the performing arts from a young age but recently found a love for producing and programming.

I am also a passionate youth climate campaigner who has been organising within the climate movement from the age of 16. Through this, I have gained extensive communications, facilitation and team building skills.

I strive to create new and diverse theatre that breaks boundaries, passes the mic and has social + climate justice at its core. âœ¨
I am currently in my final year studying BA (Hons) Theatre & Social Change at Rose Bruford.
